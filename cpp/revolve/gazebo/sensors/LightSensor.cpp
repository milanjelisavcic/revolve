/**
 * TODO Measure the fastest / most accurate way to use the light sensor.
 *
 * Currently, we let Gazebo handle the light sensor update, because
 * I assume there may be some threading advantages there. However,
 * this means that the measurement of the sensor generally lags
 * behind that of the IMU sensor by as much as the actuation time
 * (it might actually be more under bad performance circumstances);
 * which may or may not be an issue. The alternative is to force
 * the sensor to update while we are here in the read method -
 * although I have to check whether this is even possible. In any
 * case that would force the sensor update here on the "driver"
 * thread, which might be detrimental to performance.
